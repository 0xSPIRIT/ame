Features to implement:

Bugs:
- Make panels with the same buffer differ.
- Streamline x_scroll and y_scroll switching- make a function or something.
- Remove line spaces / make it not hardcoded.
- Random extra letters appearing when typing, especially after autocomplete;
    Possibly some kind of leak or something...?
- Fix crashes etc by debugging (gdb?).
- Undefined behaviour on exit... something to do with making new files??
- Performance with maximized window.

Features:
- Automatic indentation. [Find current indent level. Have a function for it.]
- Undo/Redo
- Mouse support
- Find/Replace [query?]
- Compilation / Running
