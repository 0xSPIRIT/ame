Features to implement:

x Ctrl+w crashes sometimes.
x Implement continuous incremental search functionality like emacs.
  x Highlight all matching.
  x Highlight current match and move screen to that position.
  x If outside current view, center the view onto that.
x Case insensitivity in search.
x Set new cwd upon loading file.
x Bug: Removing lines doesn't subtract from the total line count.

- Streamline x_scroll and y_scroll switching- make a function or something.
- Remove line spaces / make it not hardcoded.
- Random extra letters appearing when typing, especially after autocomplete;
    Possibly some kind of leak or something...?
- Fix crashes etc by debugging.
- Undefined behaviour at alt+f4... something to do with making new files??
- Performance with maximized window.
- Undo/Redo
- Mouse support
- Find/Replace [query?]
