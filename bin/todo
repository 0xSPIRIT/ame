Features to implement:

x Put marker where point is in inactive panel.
x Make cwd switch depending on what panel you're in.
x Remove . and .. from tab completion in minibuffer.

- "switch to buffer if you're trying to load a file already opened" doesn't work with
  multiple panels. Must switch the panel as well.
- Streamline x_scroll and y_scroll switching- make a function or something.
- Remove line spaces / make it not hardcoded.
- Random extra letters appearing when typing, especially after autocomplete;
    Possibly some kind of leak or something...?
- Fix crashes etc by debugging.
- Undefined behaviour on exit... something to do with making new files??
- Performance with maximized window.
- Undo/Redo
- Mouse support
- Find/Replace [query?]
