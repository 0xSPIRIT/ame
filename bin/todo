Features to implement:

x Make horizontal scrolling work with panels.
x Improve open-file autocomplete; bug. [Sigh, it was such a stupid error. I just missed
  setting an string array to 0 by default.]
x Bug with autocomplete with no string length in switch to buffer.
x Add line to split-screen view.
- Random extra letters appearing when typing, especially after autocomplete.
  Possibly some kind of leak or something...?
- Undefined behaviour at alt+f4... something to do with making new files??
- I-search [ctrl+f]
- Performance with maximized window.
- Undo/Redo
- Mouse support
- Streamline x_scroll and y_scroll switching- reduce the copy-pasting
