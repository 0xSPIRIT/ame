Features to implement:

x I-search [ctrl+f]
    x Implement normal search functionality.
    x Add blue highlight animation for new search.
    - Implement continuous incremental search functionality.
x Goto line.
x Make discard changes work.
x Make return count as a text input when overwriting selection.

- Removing lines doesn't subtract from the total line count.
- Random extra letters appearing when typing, especially after autocomplete.
  Possibly some kind of leak or something...?
- Undefined behaviour at alt+f4... something to do with making new files??
- Performance with maximized window.
- Undo/Redo
- Mouse support
- Streamline x_scroll and y_scroll switching- reduce the copy-pasting
