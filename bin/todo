  x Save file as...
  x Switch to buffer.
x Improve using "*" as an indicator if a buffer is not an actual file yet (as in the case
  (of *scratch* etc)
x Shift+[home,end,left,right,up,down]
x Ctrl+shift+[home,end,left,right,up,down]
x Ctrl+a
x Fix selection drawing glitch where it swaps a frame too late.
x Last character isn't in properly when loading files without a trailing \n.
x Overwrite selection.
x Improve forward/backward word behaviour.
- Center view with ctrl+l
- Mouse support
- Clean up curbuf and prevbuf. Seems sort of irrelevent / there might be a better way.
- Streamline x_scroll and y_scroll switching- reduce the copy-pasting
