Features to implement:

Features:
- Make panels with the same buffer differ.
- Mouse support
- Undo/Redo
- Compilation / Running

Bugs:
- On kill buffer, the current buffer does not switch. (Ctrl+W)
- Ctrl+tab doesn't really work properly.
- Make performance better with the indentation function- don't let it go
  through the entire file if it's a large thousand-line file. Maybe do up to
  a certain amount.
- Streamline x_scroll and y_scroll switching- make a function or something.
- Remove line spaces / make it not hardcoded.
- Random extra letters appearing when typing, especially after autocomplete;
    Possibly some kind of leak or something...?
